    <h2 class="skillssubheading">Serving</h2>

    <p class="skills">
      <b>Underhand Serve</b> <br>
      An underhand serve is a volleyball serve in which the ball is given a <br> 
      slight under-hand toss from about waist high and then struck with a <br> 
      closed fist by the opposite hand.
      <br>
      <br>
      The underhand serve is usually the first type of serve taught to a <br> 
      beginning player in youth volleyball.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Overhand Serve</b> <br>
      The overhand serve is done by tossing the ball up into the air then <br> 
      striking it with the opposite hand above the shoulder.
    </p>

    <h2 class="skillssubheading">Passing</h2>

    <p class="skills">
      Forearm passing (passing) is performed by bringing the forearms <br> 
      together to  work as a platform for passing the ball. Historically, the <br> 
      forearm platform has been the most commonly used surface for <br> 
      controlling the first ball sent over the net by a serve or an attack. 
    </p>

    <hr>
      
    <h2 class="skillssubheading">Setting</h2>

    <p class="skills">
      When you hand set, you want to train your hands to contact the ball <br>
      the same way every time. When first learning setting position, to <br> 
      start, make a triangle with your fingers. Your goal should be to <br> 
      position your hands so that the volleyball would hit you right <br>
       between the eyes if you were to let the ball go through your hands.  
    </p>

    <hr>
      
    <h2 class="skillssubheading">Spiking</h2>

    <p class="skills">
      A volleyball spike or attack is the strategy used to send the ball <br> 
      over the net to the opponent in such a manner that ball is not <br> 
      returnable. The spike is performed by moving the arm in a way <br> 
      such that you angle the ball to land on the ground of your <br> 
      opponent's side of the court. Usually a spike is hit with great force <br> 
      at a downward angle.
